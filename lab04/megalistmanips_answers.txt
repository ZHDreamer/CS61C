1. lw a0, 8(s0)        # load the address of the next node into a0
2. mv a1, s1           # put the address of the function back into a1 to prepare for the recursion
3. no return in done
4. array items are int so address must increase by 4
5. mystery overwrite t1
6. lw t1, 0(s0)        # load the address of the array of current node into t1
